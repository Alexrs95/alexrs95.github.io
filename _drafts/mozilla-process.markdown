As I announced in a previous post, this summer I will be an intern
at Mozilla in Berlin, in the Firefox Data Engineering team. I'm really
excited for this opportunity, and I want to share how I get this internship.

The process took two months, since I applied until I receive the offer.
I applied through the [Mozilla Careers website][mozilla-careers] around
mid December. The application period opens in October and ends around April,
and altough there isnt't a fixed deadline, the intern positions are limited, 
so apply ASAP!

A few days after my application, I received an email with a link to a HackerRank challenge.
This challenge consisted of two short problems and some questions, mainly about Python,
as I applied for a Python Intern position. 

Three days later, I received an email from the University Recruiter, telling me that
they would like to move me forward in the process. The next step was a set of two
phone (Skype) interviews with some Mozilla engineers.

I sent my availability and the two interviews were scheduled for the 4th of January.
This part of the process was kind of weird. The night before the interviews I received 
an email from the University Recruiter telling me that the interviewer of the second interview
had changed. I didn't care much, because although is cool to know how will be your interviewer,
so you can search what he/she does and prepare some questions for them, it's not that important.

But the day of the interview I woke up with a new email from the interviewer who had to interview me
first. He told me that he wasn't able to attend to the interview. It's OK - I thought - at least I have one
interview today.

I was wrong. The time of the interview came, and no one called me. I sent an email to my interviewer, as
the University Recruiter works in the US, and I suppose she was sleeping at that time. He replied saying that
he coulnd't do the interview. Ouch!

A couple of hours later, the University Recruiter sent me an email apologizing for what happened and scheduling 
a new interview.

Finally, the 9th of January I had the interviews. Two in a row, with fifteen minutes between them. The experience was
great. Both interviewers were friendly, and asked me questions mainly about my previous experience, my personal projects
and we were discussing some problems related with the position I applied for. And don't worry if you are appliying,
the questions weren't much difficult, and the best part is that I didn't have to code in a blank document!

I have had technical interviews with other companies for intern positions, and they ask you some questions that makes
you doubt if you are being interviewed for an internship or a senior position. I completely disagree with
how some top tech companies interview. If you are interested in this topic, you will find [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIrKC41NwC0)
interesting.

Even the creator of Boostrap failed the intern test of Dropbox!

Two weeks later, I get another email. I had another interview! This interview was scheduled for the 1st of February.
In this one, I talked with the mentor for the role. As in the previous interviews, the interviewer was
friendly, and asked me questions about my CV, my interests, and a bunch of behavioral questions, such as "What do you do
when you don't know how to solve a problem?". My advice with this sort of questions is: be honest, and be yourself.

A couple of hours later (wow, that was fast), I received an email with the subject "Final Interview with Mozilla for
Python Engineering Intern (INTL) - University 2017". They'd like to schedule this interview ASAP. It was 
with the Team Manager. She told me about the role, and asked me about my preferences, and also some behavioral questions, 
similar to the ones of the previous interview.

I did this interview the 10th of February, it was Friday so I did not expect an answer until monday. And on Monday I get it. The
University Recruiter asked me my availability for a phone call.

She called me the next day with the offer. I couldn't belive it!

## Why mozilla
Mozilla is a great company, with awesome engineers, awesome projects,
and they love Open Source! And everyone knows and have used Firefox!

## What I liked about the process
- You know who is going to interview you.
- Everyone is really friendly.
- The University Recruiters answers every doubt you have, so don't hesitate to ask them!

## What can be improved in the interview process
- As the University Recruiter was in the US, the communication between us 
was not as fluid as I expected, but I should get used to it, because in Mozilla,
engineers are all over the world.
- The process was not as clear as it could be. I didn't know exactly what to expect
in the interviews, neither at which point of the process I was.
