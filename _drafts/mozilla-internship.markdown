This year I'm living one of the most exciting adventures of my life:
Erasmus. And adventures should be followed by more adventures.

I'm happy to anounce that this summer I will be part of the Firefox Data
Engineering team, working with awesome people at Berlin as Intern.

In a future post I will talk about the interview process and how I get
this internship.

Alejandro ðŸ‘¾.
