The new year comes with new projects. To be honest, I don't believe in new year resolutions, but new projects should be eventually started, and this is a perfect excuse to do so.

Two years ago I bought this domain with the idea of creating a personal blog to talk about the stuff I'm interested in. And this is the entire story, I never wrote a post, and it's time to change this!

I'm not sure about the content of this blog. The only thing I know is that it will be written in English. It's not because I think it's cooler, but because I'm more used to read than to write in English, and this is a good way to improve my writing skills. At the end, the main objective of this blog is to learn and talk about the stuff I find interesting.

Let's enjoy learning.

Alejandro.
