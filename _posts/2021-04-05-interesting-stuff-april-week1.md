-   **[Why you can't compare Covid-19 vaccines](https://youtube.com/watch?v=K3odScka55A&feature=share):** Science is difficult. We never have ideal conditions to test our hypothesis. This video explains why we can't really compare different COVID-19 vaccines, and also that 100% efficacy is not the goal.
-   **[12 Years a Slave](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2024544/):** It took me a few years to watch this movie, but wow, if you are reading this and haven't watched it yet, do it!
-   **[Last Chance U: Basketball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13087512/):** It's interesting to see how sports (basketball in this case) can serve as a motor to achieve a better life.
