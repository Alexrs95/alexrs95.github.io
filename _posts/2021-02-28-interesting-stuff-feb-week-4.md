-   **[Noam Chomsky – Neoliberalism, Democracy and the Climate Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ81-McOgdM):** Noam Chomsky is one of the most interesting persons in the world. He's considered the father of modern linguistics. Here, he discuss politics, and the climate crisis. His ability to disect complexity and break it into little gems of wisdom is ashtonishing.
-   **[Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel](https://www.netflix.com/title/81183727):** I have to admit that these kind of shows are my guilty pleasure. I consider myself to be skeptical of everything, so I find very interesting to hear people that believe in conspiracy theories, and the reasons they give to support their ideas.
-   **[How highways make traffic worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7o3sRxA5g):** This video explains how induced demand can create more congestion, and some alternatives to make traffic better.
-   **[Space-Filling Curves - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-DgL49CFlM):** Is it possible to fill space with a cuve? Yes! Maths can be beautiful and surprising. And space-filing curves can be used to map multi-dimensional data to one dimension.
